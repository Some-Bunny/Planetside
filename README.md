# Planetside Of Gunymede

A very large overhaul mod expanding on many aspects of the game.

## Aims

- I aim to provide a true New Game+ experience for veteran players of the game, re-learning new enemy attack behaviors and provide new challenges to keep the player interested, while providing new items and weapons that interact with each other in unique and fun ways, with the **ultimate goal** being to have the *"player use their diverse amount of weapons instead of purely sticking to one gun all the time"*. 
---
### Currently includes:

- **51 Different Weapons**, with fully custom spritework and animations.
- **77 Different Passive and Active items**, all with various different unique effects.
- **28 different enemies** that you can fight in the Gungeon, all with custom lore and artwork.
- **Dozens of different room objects** and hazards that affect the moment-to-moment gameplay, or just look pretty.
- **4 different Minibosses** of varying difficulty.
- **4 different boss fights** to master and conquer, some being more secret and hidden.
- **A completely unique custom floor** with unique visuals and gameplay mechanics.
- **Multiple new shopkeepers**, some with more unique intent than others.
- **Multiple interactable shrines** to affect your run.
- **Floor modifiers** that change a normally standard floor into something different, some secret, some intended as a form of progression.
- Basegame balance changes to weapons that are either too effective or too underpowered.

**New game mechanics, such as:**

  *-A "devil deal" system sacrificing flawless boss rewards for unique upgrades for the run.*
 
  *-Unique enemy projectiles that can no longer be safely rolled over.*

  *-A risk-reward curse system on the final floor to encourage riskier play and exploring the floor instead of heading straight to the final boss.*

  *-A speedrun mechanic that spawns a unique shop on the next floor if the floor boss is defeated quickly enough.*

  *-A slow-burn infinitely scaling difficulty mode that ramps up the more you beat it, with unique modifiers and effects such as Elite enemies.*

- **Lots of other secrets...**

# Got an issue?
It happens, Gungeon is not very stable to work with. Submit something to the Issues tab and I'll get around to it whenever I can.
